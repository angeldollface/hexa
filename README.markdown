***A small three.js experiment with a 3D model of my emblem. :test_tube: :ribbon:***

## ABOUT :books:

Since I'm working on a new design for my main site and I'd like some sort of 3D models on the site, I thought that I'd experiment with a 3D model of my emblem. This repository contains the source code for this experiment.
